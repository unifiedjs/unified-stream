## What is this?

This package turns a unified processor into a (duplex) Node.js stream.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the interface is streaming but the code buffers.

## When should I use this?

You can use this if you have to use Node streams and are integrating with
unified.
As the code actually buffers, in almost all cases, you can use `unified` itself.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-stream
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import {stream} from 'https://esm.sh/unified-stream@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {stream} from 'https://esm.sh/unified-stream@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import process from 'node:process'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {stream} from 'unified-stream'

// Pipe stdin, into an HTML formatter, to stdout.
process.stdin
  .pipe(
    stream(unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeFormat).use(rehypeStringify))
  )
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
There is no default export.

### `stream(processor)`

Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream that transforms with
`processor`.

###### Parameters

*   `processor` ([`Processor`][processor])
    â€” unified processor

###### Returns

Duplex stream ([`MinimalDuplex`][api-minimal-duplex]).

### `MinimalDuplex`

Simple readable and writable ([duplex][]) stream (TypeScript type).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`MinimalDuplex`][api-minimal-duplex].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `unified-stream@^3`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
