```bash
npm install unified-stream
```

## Usage

The below example pipes stdin, into an HTML formatter, to stdout.

```js
var stream = require('unified-stream')
var rehype = require('rehype')
var format = require('rehype-format')

process.stdin.pipe(stream(rehype().use(format))).pipe(process.stdout)
```

## API
