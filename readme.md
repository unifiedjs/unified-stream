Streaming interface to [unified][] processors.

Note that the interface is streaming, but the code buffers.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-stream
```

## Use

The below example pipes stdin, into an HTML formatter, to stdout.

```js
import {stream} from 'unified-stream'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

process.stdin
  .pipe(
    stream(unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeFormat).use(rehypeStringify))
  )
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `stream`.
There is no default export.

### `stream(processor)`

Create a readable/writable stream that transforms with `processor`.
