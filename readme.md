Streaming interface to [unified][] processors.

Note that the interface is streaming, but the code buffers.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-stream
```

## Use

The below example pipes stdin, into an HTML formatter, to stdout.

```js
var stream = require('unified-stream')
var rehype = require('rehype')
var format = require('rehype-format')

process.stdin.pipe(stream(rehype().use(format))).pipe(process.stdout)
```

## API

### `createStream(processor)`

Create a readable/writable stream that transforms with `processor`.
