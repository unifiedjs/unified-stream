## What is this?

This package turns a unified processor into a (duplex) Node.js stream.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the interface is streaming but the code buffers.

## When should I use this?

You can use this if you have to use Node streams and are integrating with
unified.
As the code actually buffers, in almost all cases, you can use `unified` itself.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-stream
```

## Use

```js
import {stream} from 'unified-stream'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

// Pipe stdin, into an HTML formatter, to stdout.
process.stdin
  .pipe(
    stream(unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeFormat).use(rehypeStringify))
  )
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `stream`.
There is no default export.

### `stream(processor)`

Create a duplex (readable/writable) Node.js stream that transforms with `processor`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type `MinimalDuplex`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
